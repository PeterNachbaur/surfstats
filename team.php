		I surf waves wherever I can find them, do front-end web-dev stuff, and tell everyone that Google keeps calling me a Shoestring
		Travel Expert because I traveled to over 30 countries on less than $25 a day. Calling Germany, Hawaii and South Africa home I'm
		always on the search for the next cool idea to push surfscore.me forward. Love ice-cream and suck at ironing my shirts!

		After diving headfirst down the cognitive science rabbit hole at Vassar College, I worked on a content curation platform at
		SmartBrief and an analytic platform for gaming at Warner Brothers. When I'm not dreaming up tools to make people smarter, I love
		cooking for friends, curling up with a book, and getting layout d's in Ultimate. I'm a San Francisco native that still likes to
		think of my nine year stint on the East Coast as a 'temporary phase'

	After receiving my B.A. in cognitive science from Vassar College, I'm back in my native Boston. Right now I'm doing research in
	robotics and pursuing a Ph.D. I spend my time outside the lab obsessing over hockey, drinking IPAs and following the tech industry.

		I'm a California boy raised in New Hampshire, and I study industrial design at RISD. Being artsy-fartsy is in my nature, so my
		days always consist of thinking and making. I like to bring people together for any reason, but the only child in me does enjoy
		going on solo adventures with my board or bike. I wish I had more time to spend in the kitchen, to clean up the surfscore dishes.
